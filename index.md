# Welcome
I am currently an undergraduate at the [University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu), pursuing a degree in Computer Science and a minor in [Technology & Management](http://www.techmgmt.illinois.edu/). My primary fields of focus are UI/UX and HCI. I also enjoy running and listening to any sort of music in my spare time.
